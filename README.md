Overview

Central Mass Transfer Cosmology (CMT) is a boundary-condition theory that addresses a known limitation of standard cosmology:

ΛCDM describes the evolution of matter, not its origin.

CMT proposes a mathematically consistent way to supply the initial matter content required by ΛCDM, without modifying ΛCDM’s equations or violating its domain of validity.


Core Idea (One Paragraph)

ΛCDM assumes a non-zero matter density at its starting time but does not explain how that matter appeared.
CMT treats the universe as an open system prior to the emergence of 4D spacetime, allowing a finite mass inflow across a boundary (e.g., higher-dimensional or external reservoir).
Once sufficient mass exists, spacetime geometry and ΛCDM dynamics emerge unchanged.
CMT therefore complements ΛCDM by providing an origin boundary condition, not a competing evolution model.


What CMT Is Not

•	❌ Not a modification of ΛCDM equations

•	❌ Not a late-time interaction model

•	❌ Not baryogenesis or dark-sector decay

•	❌ Not a claim of experimental confirmation


What CMT Does

•	✔ Identifies a no-go theorem: ΛCDM cannot generate matter from zero

•	✔ Separates pre-geometric physics from cosmological fluid dynamics

•	✔ Introduces matter via a boundary inflow, not via ΛCDM dynamics

•	✔ Recovers standard ΛCDM exactly after the boundary

•	✔ Uses mathematics transparently, step-by-step


Structure of the Work
1.	ΛCDM domain analysis
2.	Mathematical no-go proof for matter creation within ΛCDM
3.	Pre-geometric open-system formulation
4.	Boundary mass inflow hypothesis
5.	Emergence of spacetime and geometry
6.	Mapping to ΛCDM initial conditions
7.	Optional effective Γ(a) representation (distributional, not dynamical)
8.	Comparison with baryogenesis and standard assumptions


Mathematical Philosophy

•	No use of H, p, T, or a(t) before they are defined

•	No backward extrapolation of ΛCDM beyond its validity

•	Boundary conditions are treated explicitly, not hidden

•	All parameters are fixed by observation, not tuned


Intended Purpose

This repository is intended for:

•	Conceptual clarity

•	Educational value

•	Open discussion

•	Further refinement


It is not positioned as a final or experimentally verified theory.


Why This Matters

Many cosmological models implicitly assume what they later evolve.

CMT makes that assumption explicit, isolates it, and treats it as a physical boundary problem.

Even if CMT is ultimately incomplete, the framework:

•	clarifies what ΛCDM can and cannot explain

•	highlights the importance of boundary conditions in cosmology

•	demonstrates careful separation between effective theory and origin physics
